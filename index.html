				Welcome to My portfolio, code is a set of instructions (or rules) that computers can understand; it might be helpful to think of code as a recipe.People write code, code powers computers and computers power many everyday objects like phones, watches, microwaves and cars.In fact, almost anything powered by electricity uses code.There are many names for people who code: coders, programmers, developers, computer scientists, software engineers, etc.But just as people can understand different languages computers can understand different languages (like Python, C, C++, Perl, Visual Basic, Java, Javascript, Ruby and PHP, among others) which translate our instructions into binary.Javascript is for for the web, and this is what my program instructors have focused on for the most the time and I have enjoyed it for the most part.
