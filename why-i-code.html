			<h2>Why I Code</h2>

				Learning to program a computer, even if you don't plan on becoming a software engineer, has three similar reasons to pursue it.Learning to code is also great practice for precise, disciplined, and abstract thinking. A program either works, or it doesn't. It could have bugs, straightforward or subtle, that require analysis and concentration. But unlike math, a program does something immediately practical.

It could have bugs, straightforward or subtle, that require analysis and concentration. But unlike math, a program does something immediately practical.Programming transforms your computer from a home appliance to a power tool. Whether you have an office job, are a student, or just go online a lot, people use computers to get stuff done. But some tedious, lengthy computer tasks are so specific or context-dependent that no one has produced software to do it. (My next programming book addresses exactly these kinds of problems.) Even without deep programming knowledge, coding becomes a large productivity multiplier. Computers are everywhere; they should be tools, not appliances. A tool is something you sharpen, an appliance is something you replace.
